# The-Motzarrella-Sticks
## Group Members:
### - Stefanie Motsenbocker (Team Captain)
- In charge of part A) A doubly linked list node class (they call it "Cell" in the instructions) that holds Particles.
### - Mark Madla
- In charge of part D)  A ParticleGraphics class that can change the color being drawn (private member variable with getter/setter) and methods for drawing a point, a rectangle, an oval, a polygon, and a line. The constructor/getter/setter should be written now, the other methods should be stubbed out.
### - *Evan Bethel* 
- Was In charge of *Part C, ParticleSystems class*
### - Terry Matamet Salas
- In charge of part B)  A Particle class that has a position, a velocity, a lifetime (how many frames it lasts until it dies), a movement type (STREAMER - particle moves in a straight line, BALLISTIC - particle is affected by gravity, its velocity in the y direction changes by 1 each frame, and FIREWORK - explodes in streamers when it reaches the end of its lifetime). It needs a physics method (stub it out), and a draw method (stub it out).
